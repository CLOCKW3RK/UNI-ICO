# UNI-ICO
A universal emulator icon maker for Windows 10. Still in Alpha.
Make sure to rename folder to UNI-ICO if you download the source code as a ZIP. (Not nessecary for cloning via terminal).
Soon this project is going to be merged with GUIGI. 
This project in esscense, makes Windows your frontend. It is not designed to replace LaunchBox by any means. I just don't use LB personally, so I came up with this.
In short, UNI-ICO makes icons for your roms and emulators that you can unify as shortcuts.
